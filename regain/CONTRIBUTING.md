## How to contribute

### TL;DR
- Fork the project & clone locally.
- Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
- Branch for each separate piece of work.
- do some work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
- Push to your origin repository.
- Create a new PR in GitHub.
- Respond to any code review feedback.

### Guide
#### 1. Fork the project and clone the forked copy on your computer.

Go to https://github.com/fdtomasi/regain/ and press on the "fork" button on the right.
Then, clone your forked copy with
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourreponame/regain.git
```
and set up the remote
```bash
$ cd regain
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/fdtomasi/regain.git
```
Now there are two remotes for this project on your computer:

- `origin` which points to your GitHub fork of the project. You can read and write to this remote.
- `upstream` which points to the main project's GitHub repository. You can only read from this remote.

#### 2. Create a branch, and make changes.
```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master && git push origin master
$ git checkout -b hotfix/readme-update
```
Feel free to replace the last line according to your preference. For example, to implement a new feature,
you may name your branch with something like
```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/new-estimator
```
#### 3. Pull Request
Push the new branch with
```bash
$ git push -u origin hotfix/readme-update
```
After the changes, go to https://github.com/yourreponame/regain/, that is the Github page of your fork of the project.
To open a PR, simply press the "Compare & pull request button".

#### 4. Review
After that, we will analyse your PR and suggest some changes, before merging the PR into our project.
