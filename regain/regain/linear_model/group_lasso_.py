    Solves the following problem via ADMM
       minimize 1/2*|| Ax - b ||_2^2 + \lambda sum(norm(x_i))

    The input p is a K-element vector giving the block sizes n_i, so that x_i
    is in R^{n_i}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array-like, 2-dimensional
        Input matrix.
    b : array-like, 1-dimensional
        Output vector.
    lamda : float, optional
        Regularisation parameter.
    groups : list
        Groups of variables.
    rho : float, optional
        Augmented Lagrangian parameter.
    alpha : float, optional
        Over-relaxation parameter (typically between 1.0 and 1.8).
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations.
    tol : float, optional
        Absolute tolerance for convergence.
    rtol : float, optional
        Relative tolerance for convergence.
    return_history : bool, optional
        Return the history of computed values.

    Returns
    -------
    x : numpy.array
        Solution to the problem.
    history : list
        If return_history, then also a structure that contains the
        objective value, the primal and dual residual norms, and tolerances
        for the primal and dual residual norms at each iteration.
